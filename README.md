## Source code repository location

The latest version of Docbrowser can be found at Github:

https://github.com/lokedhs/docbrowser

## Compatibility

The application has been tested on SBCL, CCL and CLISP. Please let me
know of any issues on other Common Lisp implementations.

## Starting the server

After loading the package, run the following command from the REPL:

```lisp
(docbrowser:start-docserver)
```

This will start the docserver on port 8080. A different port number
can also be given with an optional `:port` argument.

To access the docbrowser, point a web browser to
http://localhost:8080/

To restrict docbrowser to localhost requests, or changing the used port to 5432, you can start it with following command from the REPL:

```lisp
(docbrowser:start-docserver :port 5432 :address "127.0.0.1")
```


The main page presents a list of all the available packages. You can
click on one to see its functions and variables, with their
docstrings. You can also go to a function's source.
